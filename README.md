# Project2
I programmed the Landing Page like this:
1) I created the Css, Js folders.
2) Files:
index.html, style.css then the app.js file
3) I created after the Image folder and add the desired images.

As I programmed the html page I programmed the style.css file so as not to get confused at the end.


After seeing that everything is working fine.
I started to write my functions in the js file.
I used the const variable to declare my values and var to declare and initialize my values.
